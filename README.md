# A Guide On F1 2021:  
  

### Breaking Point(Campaign):  
  

In this game, other than having grand Prix’s and multiplayer, there is a campaign mode that you can complete by yourself. This campaign mode is about a newcomer to F1 named “Aiden Jackson” who won the F2 championship and won himself a seat in F1. After being able to show off his talent, there were some ups and down between him and his teammate “Casper Akkerman” crashed out in Australia which made Casper and Aiden become further apart. Continuing on with the story, the rival of Aiden, “Devon Butler” made more conflict between the team by telling lies to one teammate so they would get in the way of each other. Devon does this because he wants a seat at Redbull which is another team, in F1 that is capable of winning championships and more. Aiden also wants the seat but Devon Butler telling lies to his teammate makes his chances of taking the seat slim. After a lot of races happening and the rivalry between Aiden and Casper getting bigger, they finally found out about Devon Butler and his lies. Once they realised they have been played by Devon has played them, they make sure that their teams place 4rth into the constructor’s championship just so Redbull can notice Aiden Jackson.

### Multiplayer:

  

In multiplayer mode, there are a few options on which type of multiplayer you would want to. For example, you can have LAN multiplayer which means you can only play with people in the same network as you, but there are also leagues, unranked, and ranked multiplayer modes. Unranked is a game mode where anyone with any type of driving skill can all go into a match and race against each other. This is not the best of features cause some people are “dirty drivers” meaning they will crash you out for the fun of it and it makes the game not so enjoyable. Ranked on the other hand is where people with equal skill levels get into one match and you get ranked higher by being clean with other drivers and being able to gain places. Lastly, there are leagues where people race against each other who think they are good enough for the money. Leagues are organized types of races where you have a specific date on when a race is. The range of money you can get from those leagues can range from 50 to 1000 dollars depending on how popular the league is.

### Single Player:  
  

Other than breaking point being the single-player that is recommended to practice your skills in, which can make you a better driver in the long term and you can up the difficulty of the other drivers from 0% to 110%. Every person who wants to enhance their skills goes through the process of “trial and error” where they find a correct level AI for them and practice on it until they beat it. Some practice tire management in these types of races and other things like fuel, ers, and engine wear. In single-player, there is also a mode where you can play with one other friend and you can create your team or become drivers of one. This game mode makes single-player much more fun for the average user.

#### Driving:

  

Driving an F1 car around a track for a specific number of laps might sound pretty easy but it is very much the opposite. In real life, a normal person wouldn’t be able to stay conscious when even pressing on the throttle or braking in an F1 car, but in the game, it is much easier cause there aren’t G forces you have to worry about. Even if the G forces won’t affect you in-game the power when you go on the throttle will. Once you get on the throttle of the car you start spinning because of the lack of grip and this is why you have to control your throttle of slow corners. Next, there is braking. Because F1 cars have such strong brakes that the biggest enemy while braking is the tires which may lock up and cause to make your braking distance bigger. There are also racing lines, specific tires to put for specific occasions, team order, downforce, aero, and much more which I won’t be able to go into everything fully.
